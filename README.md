# Automated Document Processing

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a system that can automatically classify and extract information from business documents such as invoices, contracts, and other types of paperwork. This system leverages techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Optical Character Recognition (OCR), document classification, and information extraction to process documents efficiently and accurately.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**
- **Document Classification**
- **Information Extraction**

## Components

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
Collect and preprocess a dataset of business documents to ensure it is clean, consistent, and ready for analysis.

- **Data Sources:** Scanned invoices, contracts, PDFs, images.
- **Techniques Used:** Data cleaning, OCR preprocessing, text extraction, normalization.

### 2. Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
Convert scanned documents and images into machine-readable text using OCR techniques.

- **Tools Used:** Tesseract OCR, Pytesseract.
- **Techniques Used:** Image preprocessing (binarization, noise removal), OCR text extraction.

### 3. Document Classification
Classify documents into predefined categories (e.g., invoice, contract, receipt).

- **Techniques Used:** Text classification, machine learning models (e.g., SVM, Random Forest, Neural Networks).

### 4. Information Extraction
Extract specific information from documents, such as dates, amounts, and key terms.

- **Techniques Used:** Named Entity Recognition (NER), regular expressions, rule-based extraction, deep learning models (e.g., BERT, SpaCy).

### 5. Data Visualization and Reporting
Visualize the extracted information and classification results to provide insights.

- **Tools Used:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Power BI, dashboards.

### Data Preparation

1. Place raw document files in the data/raw/ directory.
2. Run the OCR preprocessing script to extract text from documents:
    ```bash
    python src/ocr_preprocessing.py
    
### Running the Notebooks

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    
2. Open and run the notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to preprocess data, classify documents, extract information, and visualize data:
